once upon a time i was looking for a story in the README, 
the file was barren, so i created a new one, 
in the hope the rabbit finds the carrot 


It was a large lovely garden,

### there was once Nothing. Absolutely nothing. No thoughts, no feelings, no matter, no mass, not even time existed. There was no beginning nor an end to this madening void of.. nothing. You couldn't call it 'empty' because emptyness would imply that there once was 'sommething' 'somewhere'. But there wasn't. there was no empty space where there was nothing. even that empty space existed. And out of this 'nothingness' came a story.... 

The emptiness gradually filled with lots of thoughts thanks to contributors.

They all added their thoughts, feelings and else.

Everything has been updated.
